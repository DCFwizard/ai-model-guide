    "excerpt": "MoonshotAI releases Kimi K2 Thinking, a groundbreaking 1T parameter reasoning model that outperforms GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 on major benchmarks while costing six times less to operate.",
    "content": "MoonshotAI has officially released Kimi K2 Thinking, a groundbreaking reasoning variant of the Kimi K2 family that is already making waves across benchmarks and the AI community. With this release, MoonshotAI cements its position among the global leaders in large-scale open-weight models—especially in reasoning and agentic tasks.\n\n## 🚀 What Is Kimi K2 Thinking?\n\nKimi K2 Thinking is the first reasoning-focused model in the Kimi K2 family, following the earlier Kimi K2 Instruct models launched in July and September 2025. While those earlier models focused on instruction following, K2 Thinking takes a bold step toward advanced reasoning and agentic autonomy.\n\nWith 1 trillion total parameters and 32 billion active parameters, K2 Thinking is among the largest open-weight models ever released. Despite its immense scale, MoonshotAI has optimized efficiency through native INT4 precision—a strategic departure from the FP8 precision used in earlier models.\n\nThanks to quantization-aware training, K2 Thinking achieves remarkable performance while maintaining a manageable 594GB model size, roughly half that of K2 Instruct (over 1TB). This innovation enables faster inference, reduced hardware demands, and better compatibility with pre-Blackwell NVIDIA GPUs, which lack FP4 support.\n\n## 💡 Key Features and Capabilities\n\n**Open-weight reasoning model with 1T parameters (32B active)**\n\n**INT4 precision** for enhanced efficiency and hardware compatibility\n\n**256K context window**, enabling long-horizon reasoning and memory retention\n\n**Executes 200–300 sequential tool calls** autonomously without human intervention\n\n**State-of-the-art results (SOTA)** on major reasoning and agentic benchmarks:\n- HLE: 44.9%\n- BrowseComp: 60.2%\n- Tau²-Bench Telecom: 93% – the highest score independently measured\n\nThese results place Kimi K2 Thinking ahead of even some of the most advanced proprietary models. In several benchmarks, it reportedly outperforms GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet, while costing six times less than Sonnet to operate.\n\n## 🧠 Built for Reasoning and Agentic Intelligence\n\nK2 Thinking's architecture mirrors that of K2 Instruct but introduces a crucial innovation: it is optimized for \"test-time scaling.\" This means the model can scale both thinking tokens and tool-calling turns, allowing it to handle extended multi-step reasoning tasks—such as complex customer service workflows, agentic searches, and software development processes.\n\nIn fact, K2 Thinking's agentic task performance—particularly on 𝜏²-Bench Telecom, where the model acts as a virtual customer service agent—has been exceptional. It scored 93%, marking a new high for tool use in long-horizon agentic contexts.\n\n## ✨ Beyond Performance: Natural and Human-Like Interaction\n\nBeyond raw capability, K2 Thinking represents a qualitative leap in interaction. The model is now more expressive, personal, and emotionally attuned in its responses, enhancing human-AI communication—particularly in creative and conversational use cases.\n\n## 🌐 Availability and Access\n\nKimi K2 Thinking is now live on Kimi.com in chat mode, with full agentic mode coming soon. The model is also accessible via API, enabling developers and enterprises to integrate its reasoning and agentic capabilities into their applications.\n\n## 🧩 Why It Matters\n\nKimi K2 Thinking signals a major milestone in open-weight AI. By combining trillion-parameter scale, efficient quantization, and world-class reasoning ability, MoonshotAI has narrowed the gap between open and proprietary AI systems.\n\nWith China rapidly catching up in large-model development, K2 Thinking stands as a strong example of how open-weight innovation can deliver state-of-the-art reasoning and cost efficiency—potentially reshaping the global AI landscape.",
