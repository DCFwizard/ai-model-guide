Magistral Medium 1.2 is a frontier-class multimodal reasoning language model released by Mistral AI in September 2025. It is part of Mistral's Magistral series, which comes in two variants: Magistral Small (a 24B-parameter open-source model) and Magistral Medium (a more powerful enterprise model). Magistral Medium is specifically fine-tuned for step-by-step logical reasoning and supports transparent chain-of-thought in multiple languages. This means it can show its reasoning process explicitly, making it valuable for applications where transparency and verifiability are crucial. It achieved strong benchmark performance, notably 73.6% on the AIME2024 reasoning benchmark, demonstrating its capability to handle complex mathematical and logical problems. The model offers an expanded 128k token context window for handling very lengthy inputs, allowing it to process substantial documents, codebases, or research papers in a single session. Despite its focus on complex reasoning, Magistral Medium is optimized for speed – in Mistral's Le Chat platform, a new "Flash Answer" mode allows up to 10× faster token generation compared to many competitors. This combination of deep reasoning capability and fast generation makes it uniquely positioned in the market. The model is multimodal, supporting both text and vision inputs, enabling it to analyze diagrams, charts, and images alongside text. Mistral trained Magistral using advanced techniques including supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces and reinforcement learning to achieve transparent, verifiable reasoning.
