  "summary": "Mistral's pricing strategy balances accessibility with enterprise features. The free tier allows experimentation, while paid plans scale from individual use ($14.99/month) to team collaboration ($24.99/user/month) to full enterprise deployment. The availability of open-source Magistral Small provides an alternative for budget-conscious users, though the full power of Medium is reserved for paid tiers. This tiered approach makes Magistral accessible to a wide range of users while supporting Mistral's continued development."
