  "description": "Advanced open-source large language model with Mixture-of-Experts architecture focused on coding and agentic tool use. Features 230B total parameters with only 10B active per inference, achieving frontier-level intelligence at dramatically lower computational cost. Ranked #1 among open models on aggregate intelligence index, excels at autonomous agent tasks, tool use, and coding.",
