Developer: MiniMax AI – a Chinese AI startup founded around 2021/2022. They gained notice for their previous model (MiniMax-M1) and especially this M2 release. The company's mission focuses on "full-stack self-developed model family" and enabling agentic AI for real-world tasks. They are part of a wave of Chinese AI firms pushing open or semi-open models. MiniMax's team includes AI researchers and likely ex-big tech folks. They open-sourced M2 under MIT license, highlighting commitment to open community. They also made M2's weights available on multiple platforms (Hugging Face, GitHub, ModelScope). The company's site lists not just text LLMs but also speech, video, music models – they are building an ecosystem. MiniMax-M2 specifically was unveiled in October 2025. The developer presumably offers support and perhaps enterprise fine-tuning for clients using M2, but the open MIT release indicates they bank on widespread adoption to drive either consulting or a platform around it.
