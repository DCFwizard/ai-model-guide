  "speed_explanation": "Llama 4's Scout (109B) is relatively fast for its size due to optimizations. The Maverick MoE version means that even though total params are huge, only a subset fires each time (17B active), so it can generate faster than an equivalent dense model. However, it's still a large model – not as lightning-fast as a 7B or 13B model. Interactive use is smooth on proper hardware, but inference might incur some latency, especially if using the full 2T param mode with many experts across multiple GPUs. The long context support might slow it down if you actually feed it millions of tokens. Overall, it's impressively engineered and certainly not slow, but smaller specialized models could be faster in raw throughput.",
  "quality_explanation": "Llama 4 is top-tier in quality among open models and even competes with closed models. It's very good at reasoning (reportedly beating GPT-4 on some tests after fine-tuning), strong at coding and multilingual dialogue. The inclusion of expert modules likely improved specialized knowledge and reduced hallucinations. The only models that might edge it out are possibly GPT-5 or Gemini 2.5 in certain extremely complex domains. But practically, for most evaluations it's in the same league as the best. Since it's open, the community can fine-tune and ensemble it further, potentially even boosting its quality in niche areas beyond what closed models do.",
  "cost_explanation": "As an open model under a Meta license, it's effectively free to use aside from running costs. This cannot be overstated: you get near-state-of-art performance without usage fees. Compared to paying usage-based fees for GPT/Gemini/Claude, running Llama 4 can save huge costs if you have consistent high volume usage. Many businesses will find it economically game-changing to deploy Llama 4 instead of paying millions to API providers. Yes, you have to invest in hardware or cloud resources, but those can be optimized and reused. The community license allows commercial use (with some conditions), so you avoid the per-query markup and vendor lock. For what it offers, Llama 4 is about as cost-efficient as it gets – basically the cost of computation with no premium. This democratizes AI at the highest level."
