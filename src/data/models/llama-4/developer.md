Developer: Meta AI (formerly Facebook AI Research). Meta's team (headed by Yann LeCun and others) developed Llama 4. It's the successor to Llama 3 (which was integrated into Meta's products like Facebook and WhatsApp as of late 2024). Llama 4's release in April 2025 was publicly announced on Meta's AI blog. Meta collaborates with academic partners as well – some aspects of Llama 4 (like the MoE routing) were based on recent research papers. Meta AI releases these models to maintain an open ecosystem and also to integrate into their own platforms (Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). The developer's rationale is that by releasing powerful models openly, they undercut rivals and stimulate innovation that can benefit their AI platform. From a usage perspective, the community (like developers on Hugging Face) also becomes a sort of "developer" after release, because they contribute fine-tunes and support.
