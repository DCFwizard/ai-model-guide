Developer: Alibaba Cloud Intelligence (China) – specifically the Alibaba DAMO Academy (Academy for Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook) which is Alibaba's R&D division. They also brand under Alibaba AI (Tongyi): "Tongyi Qianwen" is the Chinese name for the Qwen models. Qwen3-Max was announced at Alibaba's annual Aspara Conference in Sept 2025, by Alibaba Cloud CTO Zhou Jingren. It's part of Alibaba's huge investment in AI (they pledged $2B+ over three years to AI development). The company's strategy is to build world-class AI to fuel its cloud services and enterprise solutions in China and globally. Qwen3-Max's release shows Alibaba's commitment to open up advanced AI capabilities on their cloud platform, somewhat analogous to Amazon's approach with Titan or Bedrock. Notably, Qwen stands for "Quantum Wen" (Wen means language/text in Chinese) – earlier Qwen-7B and 14B were open-source. Qwen3-Max is not open-source due to its size, but the devs made it API-compatible with OpenAI to ease adoption.
