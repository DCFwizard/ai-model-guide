Grok 4 is the flagship model from Elon Musk's new AI company xAI. Touted as "the world's most intelligent model," Grok 4 is a cutting-edge large language model with native tool use and real-time search capabilities. It's designed not only to chat, but to act as an AI agent: during conversations it can autonomously perform web searches, run code, and use external tools to find information and solve problems. Grok 4 uses a massive "Colossus" supercomputer-powered training run that combined next-token prediction with extensive reinforcement learning for reasoning. The result is a model that can "think" longer and more strategically than many peers. For example, Grok can maintain focus on multi-step tasks for hours, making steady progress with factual updates. It has a 2 million token context window, allowing it to digest huge codebases or lengthy documents in one go (far beyond what most models can). Grok 4 also integrates multimodal input (text, images, voice) – it can analyze images/screenshots and even has preliminary voice understanding, making it a versatile assistant for various media. Overall, Grok 4 is positioned as a direct competitor to GPT-5 and other frontier models, pushing on reasoning prowess and agentic autonomy.
