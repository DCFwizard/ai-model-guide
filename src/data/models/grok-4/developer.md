Developer: xAI (United States) – Elon Musk's AI venture launched in 2023. The team includes former researchers from DeepMind, OpenAI, and academia. "Grok" is xAI's family of models, and version 4 was announced in July 2025. Musk has described Grok's development as an effort to create a maximally curious and truth-seeking AI, somewhat inspired by the HHGttG's Guide ("Grok" meaning to deeply understand). The Grok 4 Heavy multi-agent system reflects xAI's cutting-edge research in scaling AI reasoning via multiple cooperating models.
