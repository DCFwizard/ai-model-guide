  "summary": "An individual can experiment with Grok 4 for $30 in a month – which is pricier than ChatGPT's usual $20, but xAI is positioning Grok as a more powerful agentic AI. Businesses or AI enthusiasts who need the absolute best can go for the $300 Heavy plan. The developer API pricing is comparable to industry standards for large models. Currently, there is no free tier for Grok 4 beyond any promotional windows – it's a premium service reflecting its cutting-edge nature."
