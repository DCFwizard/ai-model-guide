Developer: Zhipu AI, a Chinese AI company operating under the Z.ai brand for international offerings, is the creator of GLM-4.6. The company's mission is to advance AGI in an open and beneficial way. Zhipu has been at the forefront of open-source LLM development – prior versions like GLM-130B and GLM-4.5 were widely recognized in the research community. For GLM-4.6, Zhipu's team introduced innovative training techniques (e.g., a hybrid MoE architecture with 16 experts, grouped-query attention, multi-token prediction decoding) and leveraged a massive amount of training data to push the model's capabilities. The result is a model that competes with the best from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others, while remaining open. Zhipu also provides the Z.ai developer platform where this model can be integrated via API, and actively maintains documentation and support for the developer community.
