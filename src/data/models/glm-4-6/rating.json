  "speed_explanation": "GLM-4.6 achieves high throughput and efficiency – it uses approximately 15% fewer tokens than its predecessor to solve tasks, and supports high parallelism. The MoE architecture with 32B active parameters (out of 355B total) provides excellent efficiency. However, running the full model still requires robust hardware infrastructure, so while it's fast for its capabilities, it's not instantaneous. Overall speed is well-balanced for a model of this power.",
  "quality_explanation": "GLM-4.6's quality is top-tier among open models, excelling in coding and reasoning to the point of nearing closed-source leaders. It outperforms many models (like DeepSeek-V3.2) on agent, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, and comes close to Anthropic's Claude 4.5 on certain coding evaluations. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among open LLMs with exceptional alignment, making it one of the highest-quality open models available.",
  "cost_explanation": "GLM-4.6 is outstanding in cost-effectiveness. The open availability means no licensing fees, and the ultra-low-cost subscription plans ($3-15/month for professional coding assistance) make it one of the most cost-effective advanced LLMs on the market. Organizations can self-host for free or use affordable cloud services, making professional-grade AI accessible at unprecedented price points. This represents exceptional value for the performance delivered."
