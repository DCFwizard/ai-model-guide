GLM-4.6 is the latest iteration of the Generative Language Model (GLM) series by Zhipu AI (branded as Z.ai). It is a cutting-edge large language model designed for intelligent agent applications, with 355 billion total parameters (of which 32 billion are active at inference time, using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture). GLM-4.6 builds upon the prior GLM-4.5, bringing significant improvements: an expanded context window of 200K tokens (up from 128K) for handling extremely long inputs, substantially better performance on coding tasks (it excels in code generation and can produce polished front-end code outputs), and advanced reasoning capabilities with built-in tool use support. The model also demonstrates more 'agentic' behavior – it's better at using tools, performing web searches, and integrating into agent frameworks, making it ideal for creating AI agents that can plan and act. Additionally, GLM-4.6 shows refined natural language generation with improved alignment to human preferences, producing clearer, more readable, and more contextually appropriate responses (even in complex role-playing scenarios). Zhipu has open-sourced the model weights, so GLM-4.6 is one of the most powerful open models currently available, achieving state-of-the-art results among open LLMs – it outperforms many domestic and international models (like DeepSeek-V3.2 and others) on agent, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, and comes close to Anthropic's Claude 4.5 on certain coding evaluations.
