Developer: Google DeepMind (U.S./UK) – Gemini 3 is developed by Google DeepMind, the result of collaboration between Google and DeepMind (which merged into a single AI research division under Alphabet called Google DeepMind). The project was introduced and led by key figures at Google DeepMind including CEO Demis Hassabis, with Google's CEO Sundar Pichai highlighting its significance as Google's most intelligent model. Google DeepMind is the same organization that created groundbreaking AI systems like AlphaGo and AlphaFold, now applying that expertise to general-purpose AI assistants. The model leverages Google's vast research infrastructure, massive training datasets (including text, code, images, YouTube transcripts, and more), and advanced TPU hardware for training and deployment at scale. The official announcement emphasizes that Gemini 3 is "built on a foundation of state-of-the-art reasoning" – underscoring Google DeepMind's role as the driving force behind this breakthrough model.
