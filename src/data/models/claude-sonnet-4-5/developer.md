Developer: Anthropic (USA) – An AI safety-focused startup co-founded by ex-OpenAI researchers. Anthropic's "Claude" series is their answer to GPT. Claude 4.5 was released in September 2025. Notably, Anthropic developed Claude with an emphasis on "Constitutional AI", a technique where the AI is trained to follow a set of principles (a "constitution") to ensure helpful and harmless behavior. The Claude Sonnet line specifically involved close collaboration with partners like Google (it's available on Google Cloud Vertex AI and Amazon Bedrock). Anthropic's team has continually iterated on Claude, with 4.5 being the latest major upgrade before a potential Claude 5.
