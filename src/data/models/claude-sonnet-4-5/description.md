Claude Sonnet 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced Claude-series model as of 2025. It's a frontier LLM optimized for coding, complex reasoning, and "agentic" tasks. The model earned the "Sonnet" moniker due to its focus on extended coherent outputs (much like a sonnet has structured form) and long-form reasoning. Claude 4.5 Sonnet is described by Anthropic as "the best coding model in the world" and "the strongest model for building complex agents" to date. It has significant improvements in using tools and computers directly – for example, it can write and execute code, call external APIs, or control a browser as part of its responses (features that make it excel at autonomous agents). In internal benchmarks, Claude 4.5 maintained focus on tasks running 30+ hours long, demonstrating remarkable persistence for lengthy workflows. This model also introduced enhanced "extended thinking" modes and context awareness: it tracks its own token usage and can update its plan after each tool use, which prevents it from losing track during very long problem-solving sessions. With a huge context window (up to 1 million tokens in some configurations), Claude Sonnet 4.5 can ingest extremely large inputs (like whole code repositories or long documents) without breaking stride. In terms of raw intelligence, it made leaps over its predecessor Claude 2, narrowing the gap with OpenAI's models on key benchmarks. For instance, it achieved state-of-the-art results on coding evals like SWE-Bench Verified, and dramatically improved multi-step math and reasoning performance. Despite its power, Anthropic also emphasized alignment and safety: Claude 4.5 is their "most aligned frontier model" yet, meaning it's better at following user intent while adhering to safety guardrails. Notably, it now explains its refusals in detail rather than just saying "can't do that," giving more transparency when it cannot comply.
