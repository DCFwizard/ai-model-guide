Developer: LG AI Research (the artificial intelligence R&D arm of LG Group) is the primary developer of EXAONE 4.0. LG AI Research has been focusing on foundation models and AI infrastructures, aiming this model at B2B applications rather than direct consumer use. The development was in collaboration with partners (e.g., the model references Nemotron technology from NVIDIA for certain components, and LG has worked with hardware startups like FuriosaAI to run EXAONE efficiently on specialized NPUs). The result is a model built to be enterprise-grade: scalable, with a strategic roadmap that includes multimodal extensions (e.g. EXAONE Vision Language) and domain-specific versions (like healthcare-focused EXAONE Path).
