EXAONE 4.0 is a flagship large language model from LG AI Research, notable for its hybrid dual-mode architecture. It integrates two operating modes within a single system: a fast 'Non-Reasoning' mode for quick, straightforward tasks, and a deep 'Reasoning' mode for complex problem-solving that requires step-by-step analysis. The model is available in two sizes – a high-performance 32B-parameter model and a lightweight 1.2B-parameter model designed for on-device use (e.g. in smartphones or appliances). Both versions are multilingual, supporting at least English, Korean, and Spanish fluently. EXAONE 4.0 features an extended context window (up to 128K tokens) enabled by an efficient sliding window attention mechanism, allowing it to handle very long documents while maintaining low computational overhead. This model is considered Korea's first hybrid AI of its kind, and LG optimized its training pipeline with a blend of supervised fine-tuning (including code and tool use) and advanced reasoning reinforcement learning to achieve high-quality, reliable outputs. In benchmarks, EXAONE 4.0 has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in certain domains – outperforming some rival models from Alibaba, Microsoft, and Mistral on science, math, and coding tests – while remaining more computationally efficient than much larger models (it attains comparable performance to models 5–20× its size in knowledge tasks).
