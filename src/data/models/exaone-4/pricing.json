  "summary": "Organizations can experiment with EXAONE for free locally, and then opt for paid usage on the cloud if they need production-level scaling. There are no traditional subscription plans directly from LG; instead, cost comes into play when using third-party services like FriendliAI or if deploying on cloud hardware, but API token pricing details are usage-dependent and not fixed."
