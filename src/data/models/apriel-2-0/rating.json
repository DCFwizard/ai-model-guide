  "speed_explanation": "Apriel 2.0 is designed to be highly efficient – its smaller size (15B parameters) and optimizations aim for faster inference and lower hardware requirements. The model delivers low-latency performance crucial for real-time enterprise applications and autonomous agents. It can operate on edge hardware and on-premises deployments without cloud connectivity, ensuring quick response times. This optimization makes it one of the fastest enterprise-grade reasoning models available.",
  "quality_explanation": "Apriel 2.0 delivers very strong reasoning performance, engineered to match the accuracy of much larger models at a fraction of their size. It provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning that can be audited – critical for enterprise trust and compliance. The multimodal capabilities allow it to understand documents, forms, and screenshots accurately. While it's tailored for accuracy and transparency in enterprise scenarios, it's still relatively new and will be refined as it reaches production readiness in Q1 2026. Quality is excellent for its size and purpose, though not quite at the absolute frontier level of the largest proprietary models.",
  "cost_explanation": "Apriel 2.0 achieves a perfect cost rating due to being completely open-source under MIT license with no usage fees. Organizations can deploy it freely on their own infrastructure, and it's optimized to run on less expensive hardware compared to larger models. The smaller 15B parameter size means lower operational costs while delivering enterprise-grade performance. For organizations using ServiceNow's platform, integration costs may apply, but the standalone model is free. This exceptional cost-effectiveness makes frontier-level reasoning accessible to enterprises of all sizes."
