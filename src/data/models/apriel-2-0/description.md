Apriel 2.0 is a next-generation open-weight multimodal reasoning model developed through a collaboration between ServiceNow and NVIDIA. Announced in late 2025, it represents one of the first enterprise-grade AI models that is both open-source and built specifically for complex reasoning in business workflows. Apriel 2.0 is based on NVIDIA's Nemotron architecture and is relatively compact – approximately 15B parameters (nicknamed 'Nemotron 15B' in its first version) – yet it is engineered to match the reasoning accuracy of much larger models at a fraction of their size. A key feature of Apriel 2.0 is its native multimodal capability: the model can accept and interpret not just text, but also structured documents and visual data like screenshots, forms, and diagrams as input. This allows it to understand context from interfaces or images, which is crucial in enterprise scenarios (for example, reading a screenshot of a form and reasoning about it). Apriel 2.0 is purpose-built to drive autonomous and semi-autonomous agents in corporate environments, delivering low-latency, step-by-step reasoning across various systems and databases. It comes with built-in safety guardrails and transparency features – ensuring that its reasoning process can be audited and that it meets compliance needs for regulated industries. In essence, Apriel 2.0 aims to provide 'frontier-level' intelligence for the enterprise: very high reasoning quality and reliability, but in a smaller, more efficient model that organizations can deploy more easily (ServiceNow noted it achieves the performance of models many times larger while being faster and more cost-efficient to run).
