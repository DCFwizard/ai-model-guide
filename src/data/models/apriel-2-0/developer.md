Developer: ServiceNow, in partnership with NVIDIA, is behind Apriel 2.0. ServiceNow provided expertise in workflow automation and enterprise AI needs, while NVIDIA contributed its Nemotron family model architecture and computational power for training. The collaboration is an example of combining a leading enterprise software company's domain knowledge with a leading AI hardware and research company's technology. ServiceNow's AI engineering team has been building the Apriel model family (the original Apriel 1.0 was revealed at ServiceNow's Knowledge 2025 event earlier in the year), and Apriel 2.0 is the next major iteration. NVIDIA's involvement means the model is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and integrates with NVIDIA's AI frameworks. For instance, Apriel 2.0 leverages the NVIDIA AI Factory reference design for efficient training and deployment in data centers. Both companies emphasize that Apriel was built with an 'open model, trusted AI' philosophy – ensuring that enterprises can inspect and tailor the model (ServiceNow even released a smaller Apriel 1.5 Thinker model for single-GPU use to encourage community development).
