      "description": "Organizations can deploy Apriel 2.0 on their own infrastructure with no licensing fees. The model is optimized to run on less expensive hardware compared to larger models, making it cost-efficient for on-premises or private cloud deployments.

  "summary": "No direct usage fees apply to Apriel 2.0; the primary costs would be infrastructure (compute resources to deploy it) or any ServiceNow platform subscription if one opts to use it via ServiceNow's products. The standalone model being open means even non-ServiceNow customers can experiment with it. As of the announcement, Apriel 2.0 is expected to be fully production-ready by Q1 2026, at which point more deployment options and possibly ServiceNow-hosted solutions will become available."
