  "summary": "Genspark is considered competitively priced among AI platforms – its base prices are lower or on par with similar 'AI agent' or advanced content generation tools, and importantly it doesn't hide features behind add-on fees (every plan's features are clearly defined). The pricing is primarily subscription-based with usage limits in terms of content length or task complexity. This makes it straightforward – choose a plan based on how much you plan to use it, rather than worrying about per-call charges. With a $19 entry point, Genspark offers an accessible way to get started, and scales up to professional and enterprise needs with the higher tiers."
