Developer: Genspark, Inc., a company that pivoted from an AI search engine into autonomous agents in 2025. The company was founded by former Baidu executives Eric Jing and Kay Zhu, who used their experience in AI to create this new platform. Genspark gained significant investor backing (over $160M in funding) and quickly grew its user base – reaching 2 million users within 6 months of launch. Notably, Genspark worked closely with OpenAI during development; it leverages OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model for many tasks and was one of the first to integrate OpenAI's multimodal and real-time voice APIs into an agent. The developer can thus be seen as at the cutting edge of applied AI, combining models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini, etc.) into their product. Genspark, Inc. (with leadership from ex-Baidu AI researchers) continues to develop the platform, adding features and keeping it integrated with the latest AI model advancements. Official website: genspark.ai – a web-based interface that includes tools like AI Slides, AI Chat, AI Sheets, and AI Docs, all powered by the Super Agent.
