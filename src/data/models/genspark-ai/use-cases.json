      "title": "Data Analysis and Workflow Automation",
      "content": "Genspark shines in data-heavy tasks: it can analyze financial data or large spreadsheets and produce reports or recommendations (useful for analysts who want an AI to crunch numbers and visualize data). Because it integrates with tools, it can do things like fill out forms online, extract data from websites, or integrate with APIs – meaning it can perform workflow automation (e.g., 'find leads from this website and email each an intro message'). This makes it a powerful tool for business intelligence and process automation."
