GPT-5 is OpenAI's most advanced large language model, succeeding GPT-4. It features a multi-model design: a family of sub-models (GPT-5 Main, Mini, Nano, etc.) that a routing system chooses among based on the task complexity. This allows GPT-5 to provide both deep reasoning when needed and faster responses for simple prompts. It boasts state-of-the-art improvements in accuracy and context-awareness, with OpenAI reporting ~45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4 and up to 80% fewer hallucinations in its "thinking" mode. GPT-5 can handle extremely long prompts (hundreds of thousands of tokens) and even accept images as input, enabling multimodal interactions. It's adept at coding (e.g. generating full apps from a single prompt) and can produce more "natural and humanlike" conversational responses than prior models.
