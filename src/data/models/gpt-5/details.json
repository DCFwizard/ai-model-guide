  "detailed_description": "GPT-5 is OpenAI's most advanced large language model, succeeding GPT-4. It features a multi-model design: a family of sub-models (GPT-5 Main, Mini, Nano, etc.) that a routing system chooses among based on the task complexity. This allows GPT-5 to provide both deep reasoning when needed and faster responses for simple prompts. It boasts state-of-the-art improvements in accuracy and context-awareness, with OpenAI reporting ~45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4 and up to 80% fewer hallucinations in its \"thinking\" mode. GPT-5 can handle extremely long prompts (hundreds of thousands of tokens) and even accept images as input, enabling multimodal interactions. It's adept at coding (e.g. generating full apps from a single prompt) and can produce more \"natural and humanlike\" conversational responses than prior models.",

    "summary": "Users should use GPT-5 when they need the highest-quality, most reliable AI outputs—such as drafting important content, tackling hard coding or math problems, or powering applications that require advanced reasoning. For simpler or less critical tasks, lighter models (like GPT-5 Mini or older versions) might suffice, but GPT-5 shines for demanding, complex assignments."

  "rating_detail": {
    "speed_explanation": "GPT-5 is fairly fast given its complexity, thanks to the smart routing among sub-models. Simple questions get near-instant answers via the lightweight components, but very large or complex \"thinking mode\" queries can still take a bit longer as the model reasons more deeply.",
    "quality_explanation": "It currently leads in overall quality for coding, reasoning, and coherence. GPT-5 produces highly accurate, well-structured responses with significantly fewer errors than previous models.",
    "cost_explanation": "OpenAI provides an unprecedented free access to GPT-5, and the $20/month Plus plan is affordable for individuals. However, heavy users or businesses may need the Pro or Enterprise plans, which are a substantial investment. Given its advanced capabilities, many find GPT-5's value justifies the cost."
