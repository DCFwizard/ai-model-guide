    {
      "name": "Free Tier",
      "price": "Free",
      "description": "Allows one free task per day (a 'task' is a self-contained objective, equivalent to ~300 AI credits). Free users also get a one-time bonus of 1,000 credits when signing up, which lets you try a few extra tasks beyond the daily limit initially. This tier is ideal for casual users wanting to experiment with autonomous AI agents."
    },
    {
      "name": "Starter",
      "price": "$39/month",
      "description": "Provides approximately 3,900 credits per month and the ability to run up to two tasks concurrently. This means you could have two separate Manus tasks (agents) working at the same time, useful for parallelizing work. Includes more stable and faster performance with dedicated resources, extended context length for handling more data, and priority access during peak usage times."
    },
    {
      "name": "Pro",
      "price": "$199/month",
      "description": "Includes approximately 19,900 credits monthly and allows up to five concurrent tasks, plus access to beta features for cutting-edge capabilities. This tier is designed for power users who need to run multiple complex tasks simultaneously or have very large workloads. Comes with all the performance benefits of paid plans including dedicated infrastructure and extended context."

    {
      "name": "Team",
      "price": "$39/seat/month (minimum 5 seats)",
      "description": "Priced at $39 per seat/month with a minimum of 5 seats (i.e., $195/month minimum). This plan provides a shared pool of 19,500 credits for the team and features like dedicated infrastructure for better performance. Designed for organizations that need collaborative access to Manus with shared resources and centralized billing."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "All paid plans come with advantages over the free tier: more stable and faster performance (dedicated resources), extended context length (Manus can handle more data or longer inputs), and priority access during peak usage. Manus operates on a credit system where each action the agent takes (e.g., a chunk of text processed or a web interaction) consumes credits. Higher plans are necessary for larger tasks or many tasks to run. There is no separate API pricing, as Manus is primarily offered as a consumer-facing or enterprise agent service."
