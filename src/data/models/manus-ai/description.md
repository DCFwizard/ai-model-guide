Manus AI is an autonomous AI agent platform designed to execute complex tasks independently, without continuous human guidance. Developed by the startup Butterfly Effect Technology in Singapore, Manus launched in March 2025 and has been described as one of the first fully autonomous AI agents capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and decision-making. In practical terms, Manus operates by taking high-level goals from the user (in natural language) and then breaking them down into actionable steps which it carries out on its own – from researching information and analyzing data to interacting with web services or software on behalf of the user. The system uses a 'multi-model' approach (incorporating various foundation models like Claude and others) and a suite of tools to perform tasks in a manner more akin to a human assistant than a traditional single-turn chatbot. Manus's tagline is 'less structure, more intelligence,' highlighting that you can give it a broad objective and it will figure out the procedure. This agent is notable for being proactive and can adjust its plan dynamically if it encounters obstacles, making it a cutting-edge example of an AI that tries to 'do the whole job' rather than just answer questions.
