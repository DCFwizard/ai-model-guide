Developer: Butterfly Effect Technology, also known as Butterfly Effect Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based startup founded by entrepreneur Xiao Hong and backed by notable investors (it attracted attention with a large seed funding). The development team has integrated models from other AI providers (like Anthropic's Claude family and others) into Manus's architecture, rather than building a new LLM from scratch, focusing on innovation in how the agent orchestrates tasks. The company launched Manus in early 2025 and has been iterating rapidly (Manus 1.5 was released by October 2025). Official website: manus.im – through this site, users can sign up for Manus, access the web app, or download the mobile apps (iOS and Android) for Manus.
