## Starter (Free)

**Price:** Free

Replit offers a Starter plan for trying out the platform, which includes limited Replit Agent usage (e.g., trial access with 1,200 minutes of development time) and up to 10 temporary projects. This tier is ideal for experimenting with the platform and basic learning purposes.

## Core

**Price:** $20/month

The Core tier (when billed annually) is aimed at solo developers. It includes full Ghostwriter/Agent access and comes with $25 of AI compute credits each month for running the agent, plus the ability to have private projects and live deployments. This plan provides 4 vCPUs and is suitable for moderate AI usage.

## Teams

**Price:** $35/user/month

Teams plans (annual billing) are designed for small teams collaborating on projects. Each user receives monthly credits (e.g., $40 each), up to 50 read-only collaborator seats, role-based access control, and increased resource limits. This tier is ideal for development teams that need shared workspaces and collaboration features.

## Enterprise

**Price:** Custom pricing

The Enterprise plan offers custom pricing for large organizations, with added features like SSO (Single Sign-On), SCIM user provisioning, dedicated support, and enhanced security/compliance options. This tier is designed for enterprises with specific requirements for governance, security, and scale.

---

Replit's pricing includes a base amount of AI usage credits; if you exhaust the included credits with heavy AI agent use or storage, additional usage is billed pay-as-you-go. This means costs can rise if you rely heavily on the AI, so the Core plan is best for moderate use, while Teams/Enterprise are suited for sustained usage with more predictable budgeting. The free tier is generous for learning and experimentation.
