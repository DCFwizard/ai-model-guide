Developer: DeepSeek, Inc. (with contributions from an open-source community). DeepSeek is a smaller AI company, established around 2023, known for focusing on "inclusive AGI" and openness. They embraced a philosophy similar to OpenAI's early days but chose to open-source their models. The V3 series was spearheaded by them but saw community involvement (the model's weights and training code were on GitHub, with external contributions). Notably, the core team's background included ex-Google Brain researchers and enthusiasts from the open-source AI community. DeepSeek is incorporated (likely in the US or possibly Europe), and they monetize by offering premium services (like the API, fine-tuning services, support contracts) on top of the free models. Their business model is akin to companies like Stability AI or Hugging Face – providing free tools to build adoption, then offering paid enterprise services. DeepSeek-V3 was officially released on Dec 26, 2024, with the latest minor version V3.2 in September 2025. It was accompanied by technical reports (even an arXiv paper). The developer's openness has won them goodwill; the model is sometimes referenced by academics because it's easy to analyze/modify.
