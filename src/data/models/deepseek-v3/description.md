DeepSeek-V3 is a pioneering open-weight large language model known for its unique Mixture-of-Experts architecture and emphasis on speed and cost-efficiency. Developed by a startup/community called DeepSeek, V3 was released around the end of 2024, with subsequent minor updates (V3.1, V3.2) in 2025. The core DeepSeek-V3 model is massive in scale – it has 671 billion total parameters, organized into many expert subnetworks, with about 37 billion parameters activated per token generation. This means when DeepSeek-V3 answers, it effectively functions like a ~37B model (since only relevant experts "vote" on each output), allowing it to achieve high performance at a lower runtime cost than a fully dense 671B model. One of DeepSeek's hallmark achievements with V3 was efficiency. They reported V3 generates text at 60 tokens per second, which is roughly 3× faster than their previous version (V2). This is exceptionally fast for an LLM of this size – it's in the ballpark of smaller 13B models in terms of speed, thanks to the MoE parallelism and engineering optimizations. Moreover, DeepSeek V3 was made fully open-source (with model weights and code available) under a permissive license. This open approach attracted a community of contributors and allowed it to be adopted widely in open-source AI projects. In terms of capabilities, DeepSeek-V3 is a strong general-purpose model: It excels at reasoning tasks and was one of the first open models to narrow the gap with closed models like GPT-4. For example, in late 2024 it outperformed many 30B-70B models in benchmarks due to the MoE advantage. It's good at coding (not the absolute top, but quite capable). It can write and explain code in multiple languages and was often compared favorably to models like CodeLlama-34B. It's also decent at handling context (with a context window around 128K tokens in V3.1) and supports some tool use via extensions (DeepSeek had plugins like web search and code execution through their API). The model is known for straightforward helpfulness and factual accuracy, with the team focusing on reducing hallucinations. Their "Extended Thinking" mode allowed it to break down problems step by step when instructed, leading to more reliable answers. DeepSeek emphasized being "open and cost-effective". V3 was accompanied by research showing how they achieved near state-of-the-art results at a fraction of the inference cost of other frontier models. They also provided detailed technical reports (even on arXiv) describing the MoE architecture and training process. In summary, DeepSeek-V3 stands out as perhaps the most powerful truly open model of its time, and it's engineered for speed and affordability without sacrificing much performance. It may not absolutely surpass proprietary giants like GPT-5, but it's not far behind – and often was referred to as proving what open models can do (closing the gap significantly).
