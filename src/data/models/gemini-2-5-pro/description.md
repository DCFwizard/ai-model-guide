Gemini 2.5 Pro is Google DeepMind's latest next-generation AI model, a major step beyond the earlier Gemini and PaLM models. It's often referred to as a "thinking model," because Gemini 2.5 incorporates advanced reasoning processes (sometimes called "chain-of-thought") internally before producing answers. This model is multimodal and has an enormous capacity: the Pro version launched with a 1 million token context window (and Google has teased an upcoming 2 million token version). In practical terms, 1M tokens is roughly 800k words – Gemini 2.5 Pro can ingest almost an entire library's worth of text or a whole video's audio transcript as input, enabling very deep analysis of long documents or combining information from many sources at once. Gemini 2.5 Pro is also state-of-the-art in quality. Upon release in March 2025, it debuted at #1 on the LMArena leaderboard (which measures human preferences among AI outputs), clearly outperforming previous leaders like GPT-4.5. It excels across a wide range of tasks: it leads on coding benchmarks, math and science problems, and creative writing tests. Notably, it scored 18.8% on the extremely difficult "Humanity's Last Exam" without any extra techniques (that's a state-of-the-art result for raw model performance in complex reasoning). Google describes Gemini 2.5 Pro as combining the best of two worlds: powerful base training on diverse data, and an integrated "thinking" algorithm that allows the model to plan and reason through problems internally before answering. Another key aspect: Gemini is natively multimodal. It doesn't just process text, but also images, audio, and video. By design, 2.5 Pro can take in data like pictures or diagrams and understand them alongside text prompts. This makes it capable of tasks like interpreting charts, images or design mockups as part of its reasoning (something GPT-4 had but on a smaller scale). It's also deeply integrated into Google's ecosystem – e.g., it powers features in Google's productivity apps and the Gemini chatbot app. Under the hood, Gemini 2.5 runs on Google's TPUv5 infrastructure, meaning it's highly optimized for performance. In summary, Gemini 2.5 Pro is one of the most advanced and capable AI models available, with particular strengths in reasoning, coding, and handling very large, multimodal inputs.
