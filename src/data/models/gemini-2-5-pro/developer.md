Developer: Google DeepMind (U.S./UK) – Gemini is a collaborative effort between Google Research and DeepMind (which merged into one unit in 2023). The project is led by AI luminaries like Demis Hassabis. Notably, the Gemini name reflects combining different capabilities (much like the Gemini constellation has twin stars) – specifically combining Google's AlphaGo-like planning with large language understanding. Gemini 2.5 Pro was released in March 2025. It's part of Google's strategy to regain leadership in AI; Sundar Pichai announced it as "our most intelligent model". The model leverages Google's TPU v5 hardware and enormous training datasets (text, code, images, YouTube transcripts, etc.). Google has an entire "Gemini family" of models – e.g., Gemini Nano for lightweight tasks, Gemini Flash for fast responses – but 2.5 Pro is the top-tier intended to rival or exceed OpenAI's best.
