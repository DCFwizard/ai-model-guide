  "description": "State-of-the-art open-source large language model with exceptional reasoning abilities and massive scale. Features 1T total parameters with 32B activated per token using Mixture-of-Experts architecture. Set records on Humanity's Last Exam (44.9%), excelling at deep logical reasoning, coding, and multi-step tool use. Includes 'Thinking' mode variant for extended tool-augmented reasoning with hundreds of sequential steps.",
