Developer: Moonshot AI (China). Moonshot is an AI lab founded by Yang Zhilin (a Tsinghua/Baidu alum) in 2023. They quickly grew to unicorn status by focusing on long-context and agentic AI. Moonshot was backed by big players like Alibaba, which hints at why K2 is so advanced – they had significant resources. They launched the Kimi platform (with Kimi 1.5 earlier, a 15B model, and then K2 at 1T params). Moonshot's approach is heavily on open research – publishing extensively and open-sourcing. They have a motto of "transparency and control for enterprises" in AI. Kimi K2's release was announced at a conference and on platforms like their WeChat blog and arXiv. The developer, by releasing K2, positioned themselves among top open AI providers like Meta's Llama. K2's performance forced even Western observers to acknowledge an open model exceeded some closed ones, which is a testament to Moonshot's team. Moonshot published an arXiv technical report titled "Kimi K2: Open Agentic Intelligence" detailing its architecture and alignment, demonstrating their commitment to transparency and advancing the field of open AI research.
