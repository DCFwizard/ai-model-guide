Kimi K2 is a state-of-the-art open-source large language model developed by Moonshot AI, known for its strong reasoning abilities and massive scale. K2 is built on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, featuring 1 trillion total parameters with 32 billion parameters activated per token. In simpler terms, it's an MoE model where 32B "experts" are utilized at each step, giving it extremely high capacity (comparable to the largest models in existence) while keeping inference manageable (like running a 32B dense model). Kimi K2 is often cited for its exceptional performance on hard reasoning benchmarks. In fact, it set records on tasks like Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), achieving 44.9% on that notoriously difficult test, which at release was higher than GPT-5's score on the same (GPT-5 Pro had ~42%). This indicates K2's prowess at deep logical reasoning and complex problem-solving. The model is also very capable in coding and multi-step tool use (it was designed to coordinate large reasoning chains over hundreds of steps). Notably, Kimi K2 has a "Thinking" mode variant (referred to as K2-Thinking), which is optimized for extended tool-augmented reasoning. It can execute hundreds of sequential tool calls, maintaining coherent reasoning throughout. For example, it can autonomously work on a coding project for hours, or analyze lengthy legal documents across hundreds of queries without losing context. The model's training involved massive datasets and a focus on agentic tasks. Moonshot AI, with backing from Alibaba and others, emphasized making K2 an "open agentic intelligence" that organizations can trust and verify. They even published an arXiv technical report "Kimi K2: Open Agentic Intelligence" detailing its architecture and alignment. Kimi K2 is open-source under a permissive license (likely under an MIT-style or Apache license) which allows commercial use. The community embraced K2 since it was one of the first open models to truly rival and even surpass some closed models on key benchmarks, especially in rigorous coding and reasoning tasks. One distinguishing aspect is K2's focus on efficiency and hardware: it was trained to run on as few as 8 A100 GPUs despite its trillion parameters (using compression and MoE sparseness). That means while huge, it's accessible to deploy for those with high-end hardware clusters. In summary, Kimi K2 is an open "frontier model" combining huge scale, tool-using smarts, and long-horizon autonomy – effectively Moonshot's answer to models like GPT-5 or Anthropic's Claude 4.5, but open.
