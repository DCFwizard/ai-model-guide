  "speed_explanation": "Kimi K2 is extremely powerful, but with 32B active parameters, it's a heavyweight to run. It's optimized to run on multi-GPU setups (they claim it runs on 8 A100 GPUs for the full model). Thanks to MoE, it's faster than an equivalent dense trillion-param model by far. Many routine queries it handles quickly like a 30B model would. However, if it's in \"Thinking mode\" doing 200-step tool calls, that obviously takes more wall-clock time. So for short Q&A, it's decently fast (maybe a couple tokens per second per GPU), but not as snappy as a 7B model. Considering its capability, it's impressively efficient. It's not tuned purely for speed – it's tuned for not giving up on tough tasks, which may involve being thorough rather than fast.",
  "quality_explanation": "Kimi K2 has a strong claim to be at the pinnacle of quality among all available models at its time. It scored above OpenAI's and Meta's offerings on some benchmarks, achieving 44.9% on Humanity's Last Exam (higher than GPT-5 Pro's ~42%). It's the \"most intelligent non-reasoning model\" in some evaluations, and with its \"Thinking\" variant, it likely ties or exceeds them on many tasks. Domain experts who tested it note it narrowing any gaps. It basically delivered AGI-like performance on certain tasks. It handles complex, domain-specific queries, has excellent coding and logic, and can maintain context over very long sequences. K2 arguably meets or even beats GPT-5 in some areas like HLE, making it a top-tier frontier model.",
  "cost_explanation": "K2 is open, so there's no usage fee. That's a huge plus. However, it's a large model to run – requiring significant compute and memory (32B active param is manageable, but the infrastructure for heavy multi-user deployments needs planning). Compared to paying for an API for an equally powerful model, it's far cheaper in the long run. Some references suggest K2's effective input cost is $0.15/M vs closed models at $15/M – a 100x advantage. That's extraordinary. It's extremely cost-efficient for what it delivers, though absolute compute cost is high if you only need moderate power. For those who need its level of capability, it's absolutely a money-saver versus closed options. With new hardware (H100s, etc.), running K2 becomes easier over time, making it increasingly accessible."
