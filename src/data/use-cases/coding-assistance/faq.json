    "question": "Can AI models write complete applications?",
    "answer": "Not yet. They are excellent for generating functions, components, or solving specific problems, but they cannot yet architect and build a full, complex application from scratch without significant human oversight."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is the code generated by AI secure?",
    "answer": "Not always. You should treat AI-generated code as you would code from a junior developer—it needs to be reviewed, tested, and checked for security vulnerabilities before being used in production."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I get the best code from an AI model?",
    "answer": "Be as specific as possible in your prompt. Provide context, mention the language and frameworks, give examples of input and desired output, and break down complex requests into smaller steps."
