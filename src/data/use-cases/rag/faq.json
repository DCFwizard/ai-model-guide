    "question": "Why use RAG instead of fine-tuning?",
    "answer": "RAG is better for incorporating new or rapidly changing information, as you only need to update your knowledge base, not retrain the model. It also helps reduce hallucinations by grounding the model in specific facts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a vector database?",
    "answer": "A vector database is a specialized database used in RAG to store information (like text chunks) as numerical representations called embeddings. It allows for fast and efficient searching based on semantic similarity, not just keywords."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I prevent the model from ignoring the context?",
    "answer": "Prompt engineering is key. Use a clear, forceful prompt that instructs the model to *only* use the provided documents to answer the question and to say 'I don't know' if the answer isn't present."
