It features a multi-model design: a family of sub-models (GPT-5 Main, Mini, Nano, etc.) that a routing system chooses among based on the task complexity. This allows GPT-5 to provide both deep reasoning when needed and faster responses for simple prompts. It boasts state-of-the-art improvements in accuracy and context-awareness, with OpenAI reporting ~45% fewer factual errors than GPT-4 and up to 80% fewer hallucinations in its \"thinking\" mode. GPT-5 can handle extremely long prompts (hundreds of thousands of tokens) and even accept images as input, enabling multimodal interactions. It's adept at coding (e.g. generating full apps from a single prompt) and can produce more \"natural and humanlike\" conversational responses than prior models.",

It's designed not only to chat, but to act as an AI agent: during conversations it can autonomously perform web searches, run code, and use external tools to find information and solve problems. Grok 4 uses a massive \"Colossus\" supercomputer-powered training run that combined next-token prediction with extensive reinforcement learning for reasoning. The result is a model that can \"think\" longer and more strategically than many peers. For example, Grok can maintain focus on multi-step tasks for hours, making steady progress with factual updates. It has a 2 million token context window, allowing it to digest huge codebases or lengthy documents in one go (far beyond what most models can). Grok 4 also integrates multimodal input (text, images, voice) – it can analyze images/screenshots and even has preliminary voice understanding, making it a versatile assistant for various media.

Its answers are generally detailed and correct, and it benefits from real-time data access to enhance accuracy. Grok occasionally shows a bit more \"personality\" (witty or edgy comments) due to Musk's tuning, but it stays factual for professional use. Only a few models (like GPT-5) might edge Grok out slightly in certain domains, but Grok 4 is unquestionably among the best in quality.",
      "cost_explanation": "While Grok 4 offers immense power, it comes at a premium price. The $30/month individual plan is higher than many competing services, and the $300 heavy plan is aimed at organizations with serious budgets. There is no free tier for Grok 4, which limits casual access. On the bright side, the cost does grant you unprecedented capabilities (tool use and huge context that might otherwise require multiple services). Additionally, the API pricing is roughly in line with other cutting-edge models, and xAI has maintained token prices from the previous generation. Overall, it's not \"cheap,\" but for users who truly need what Grok offers, the value can justify the expense. Smaller-scale users might find it less cost-effective compared to alternatives."
