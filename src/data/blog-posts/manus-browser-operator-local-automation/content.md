Manus is introducing a new extension called Browser Operator, a tool designed to let its AI system interact directly with a user's local browser. Instead of relying solely on its cloud-based environment, the platform can now execute tasks inside the browser session that users already work in every day.
## Integrating Local and Cloud Environments
Manus traditionally operates through a cloud browser, a sandboxed workspace created to support automation at scale. This setup allows the system to conduct research, analyze data, generate content and build digital assets without requiring anything on the user's machine. The cloud environment provides consistency and device independence, which remains useful for most workflows.
Some tasks, however, benefit from local execution. Accessing premium research tools, authenticated CRMs or platforms tied to a user's existing session often requires a trusted device and IP. These constraints are difficult to replicate in a remote environment, which is why Manus is introducing a mechanism that connects both layers.
The Browser Operator extension allows Manus to switch between its cloud browser and the user's local browser depending on the task. The goal is to combine the reliability of local authentication with the flexibility of cloud automation.
## Why Local Access Matters
When Manus operates through the user's own browser, its actions appear as though they originate from the trusted device. This removes barriers such as login challenges or CAPTCHA checks and helps maintain uninterrupted sessions.
Local execution offers several advantages:
- A trusted connection, since activity comes from the user's authenticated browser session
- Stable access, especially for tools with strict credential requirements or session-based activity
## Automating Workflows Inside Authenticated Tools
The extension enables Manus to work directly within platforms the user already has access to, including:
- Subscription-based research tools such as Crunchbase, PitchBook, SimilarWeb, Financial Times, Semrush and Ahrefs
- Authenticated internal tools, CRMs and proprietary systems that require active login sessions
Within these interfaces, Manus can perform multi-step workflows, extract information, cross-reference data and streamline reporting tasks, reducing the amount of manual navigation typically required.
## How the Extension Works
The setup process is simple:
### Enable the My Browser Connector
Turning on this connector allows Manus to route certain tasks through the local browser.
### Authorize Access When Prompted
Each task requiring local interaction triggers a request from Manus, and the user must grant permission before the task begins.
### Observe or Intervene
The system performs its operations in a dedicated browser tab. Users can watch the task in progress, take control at any time or stop it by closing the tab.
## Transparency and User Control
Manus has designed the extension around visibility and auditability. Every action is logged, giving users a detailed record of what the system does. Interrupting a workflow is immediate and does not require navigating additional menus.
Because tasks run through the user's local browser, they can be initiated or monitored remotely from another device, provided the main computer remains online.
## Availability and Current Limitations
Manus Browser Operator is being released in beta for Pro, Plus and Team subscribers. It currently supports Chrome and Edge, with further browser compatibility planned.
Some interface interactions remain challenging at this stage, including drag-and-drop operations or multi-step forms. Users working with sensitive platforms are encouraged to review permissions before allowing Manus to operate, and can always interrupt a task by closing its tab.
## The Bottom Line
Manus Browser Operator represents an attempt to merge cloud-based automation with local browser capabilities, aiming to expand how AI systems can interact with authenticated and session-dependent environments. For professionals who rely on premium research tools and authenticated platforms, this extension bridges the gap between cloud flexibility and local trust, making AI-driven automation more practical for real-world workflows.
