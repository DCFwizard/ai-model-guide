Gemini 3 Pro has emerged as the new leader in artificial intelligence. For the first time, Google holds the top position in our Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, with Gemini 3 Pro debuting three points above GPT 5.1.
Google DeepMind provided us with pre-release access to Gemini 3 Pro Preview. The model outperforms every competitor in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index and shows consistent strength across evaluation categories. It ranks first in five of the ten assessments that make up the Index. Despite its gains in intelligence, Gemini 3 Pro Preview also demonstrates improved token efficiency compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, consuming far fewer tokens than other leading models such as Kimi K2 Thinking and Grok 4. However, due to its premium pricing, at two and twelve dollars per million input and output tokens for contexts under two hundred thousand tokens, Gemini 3 Pro is among the most expensive models to run through our evaluation suite.
## Key Takeaways
### Leading Intelligence
Gemini 3 Pro Preview is the top-performing model in five of ten evaluations in the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, including GPQA Diamond, MMLU Pro, HLE, LiveCodeBench and SciCode. Its score of thirty-seven percent on Humanity's Last Exam is notable, exceeding the previous best model by more than ten percentage points. It also leads in AA Omniscience, our new knowledge and hallucination benchmark, placing first in both the Omniscience Index and Omniscience Accuracy. Since factual recall tends to correlate with model size, these results suggest that Gemini 3 Pro may be significantly larger than its competitors.
### Advanced Coding and Agentic Capabilities
Gemini 3 Pro Preview leads two of the three coding evaluations in the Index, achieving fifty-six percent in SciCode, a gain of more than ten percentage points over the previous highest score. It also performs strongly in agentic environments, securing the second-highest scores in Terminal Bench Hard and Tau2 Bench Telecom.
### Multimodal Performance
Gemini 3 Pro Preview is fully multimodal, accepting text, images, video and audio as input. It achieves the highest score of any model on MMMU Pro, a benchmark focused on image-based reasoning. Google now holds the first, third and fourth positions on our MMMU Pro leaderboard, with GPT 5.1 currently in second place.
### Premium Pricing
To measure cost, we report the Cost to Run the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, which integrates token prices and token efficiency to reflect real usage expenses. Although Gemini 3 Pro Preview improves efficiency over Gemini 2.5 Pro, it remains more expensive to operate. Its token pricing for contexts up to two hundred thousand tokens results in a twelve percent increase in total evaluation cost compared to its predecessor. Google also applies higher prices to long context workloads, at four and eighteen dollars per million input and output tokens for contexts of at least two hundred thousand tokens.
### Speed
Gemini 3 Pro Preview delivers output speeds comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro, producing one hundred twenty-eight output tokens per second. This places it ahead of other frontier models such as GPT 5.1 (high), Kimi K2 Thinking and Grok 4, likely supported by Google's TPU-based acceleration stack.
## Additional Details
Gemini 3 Pro Preview offers a one million token context window and supports tool calling, structured outputs and JSON mode.
## The Bottom Line
Gemini 3 Pro Preview represents a significant milestone in AI development, demonstrating that Google DeepMind continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with large language models. While its premium pricing may limit widespread adoption, for use cases requiring the absolute highest level of intelligence—particularly in scientific reasoning, advanced coding, and multimodal analysis—Gemini 3 Pro Preview sets a new standard that competitors will need to match.
