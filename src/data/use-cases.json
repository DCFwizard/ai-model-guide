    "icon": "BookText",
    "overview": "Summarization is the task of creating a short, accurate, and coherent version of a longer text document. AI models excel at this by identifying key points and generating fluent summaries, saving significant time and effort in processing large volumes of information.",

    "faq": [
      { "question": "What's the difference between extractive and abstractive summarization?", "answer": "Extractive summarization selects key sentences directly from the source text, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences to capture the core meaning, which is what modern LLMs do." },
      { "question": "How can I improve summary quality?", "answer": "Use clear, specific prompts. For example, instead of 'Summarize this,' try 'Summarize this meeting transcript into a list of key decisions and action items.'" },
      { "question": "Can models summarize audio or video?", "answer": "Yes, but it's a two-step process. First, you need a speech-to-text model to transcribe the audio, then you can feed the transcript to a text model for summarization." }

    "description": "Answer questions using a private knowledge base for accurate, context-aware responses.",
    "icon": "Database",
    "overview": "RAG is a technique that enhances LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge bases. Instead of relying solely on its training data, the model first retrieves relevant information from your documents and then uses that information to generate a more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable answer.",
    "recommendations": {
      "premium": { "model_id": "cohere-command-class", "reason": "Specifically designed for enterprise RAG with strong grounding and citation features." },
      "balanced": { "model_id": "gpt-4-class", "reason": "A powerful and reliable choice with excellent reasoning over retrieved context." },

      { "title": "Speed and Cost", "description": "RAG can be token-intensive. Efficient models are crucial for maintaining a good user experience and managing costs." },
      { "title": "Tool Use / Function Calling", "description": "Robust function calling is essential for integrating the retrieval step into the model's workflow." }
    ],
    "faq": [
      { "question": "Why use RAG instead of fine-tuning?", "answer": "RAG is better for incorporating new or rapidly changing information, as you only need to update your knowledge base, not retrain the model. It also helps reduce hallucinations by grounding the model in specific facts." },
      { "question": "What is a vector database?", "answer": "A vector database is a specialized database used in RAG to store information (like text chunks) as numerical representations called embeddings. It allows for fast and efficient searching based on semantic similarity, not just keywords." },
      { "question": "How do I prevent the model from ignoring the context?", "answer": "Prompt engineering is key. Use a clear, forceful prompt that instructs the model to *only* use the provided documents to answer the question and to say 'I don't know' if the answer isn't present." }

They can generate boilerplate code, write unit tests, refactor existing code, and provide explanations for complex algorithms.",

    "faq": [
      { "question": "Can AI models write complete applications?", "answer": "Not yet. They are excellent for generating functions, components, or solving specific problems, but they cannot yet architect and build a full, complex application from scratch without significant human oversight." },
      { "question": "Is the code generated by AI secure?", "answer": "Not always. You should treat AI-generated code as you would code from a junior developer—it needs to be reviewed, tested, and checked for security vulnerabilities before being used in production." },
      { "question": "How can I get the best code from an AI model?", "answer": "Be as specific as possible in your prompt. Provide context, mention the language and frameworks, give examples of input and desired output, and break down complex requests into smaller steps." }
